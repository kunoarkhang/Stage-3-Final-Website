      <h2>INSPIRATION</h2>
      <p1 class="inspiration">
        In her Brooklyn studio, designer Sara Sakanaka keeps a small drawstring
        bag that her grandmother made for her decades ago. Sewn from textile
        scraps, the striped pouch is one of Sakanaka’s oldest keepsakes, an
        heirloom representing a generations-old philosophy. “My mom used to tell
        me this story. It was about how if we treat objects with love and care
        for one hundred years, they can obtain a soul,” she shares as pours each
        of us a cup of Mugicha, a Japanese Barley tea that she grew up drinking.
        We met at her studio on a gray Tuesday morning, where a collection of
        silk separates, each made from reclaimed Japanese kimonos, hangs neatly.
        On a shelf, folded piles of salvaged textiles wait for her to sew them
        into something new, just like her grandmother once did as a hobby.
        “There’s this whole idea that objects have lives,” she says. “I like to
        see every piece as a true considered object in that way.” that objects
        have lives,” she says. “I like to see every piece as a true considered

        cutout, and a frothy fall 1986 Chanel gown. The thing that Zendaya and
        Hadid have in common? They were both styled by Law Roach, who has an eye
        for throwback finds. “No matter if it was made in 1920 or 2020, a great
        dress is a great dress,” Roach told Vogue last month. Some other
        celebrities were devoted to one particular vintage label. Kylie Jenner,
        for one, was obsessed with archival Mugler this year. At the opening of
        a Mugler retrospective at the Brooklyn Museum last month, she wore a

        First things first: We’d be remiss to not acknowledge that the last time
        we heard from designer Alexander Wang, it was during the fallout from
        accusations of sexual misconduct. After denying the allegations, the
        designer later released a public apology and then met with his accusers
        in private; their lawyer, Lisa Bloom, subsequently released a statement
        that the accusers acknowledged Wang’s apology and were moving forward.
        So last night he staged something of a “comeback”—and a savvily
        orchestrated one at that. For a designer known for his cheeky spirit,
        Wang played it safe: He was unavailable for interviews and he staged an
        open-to-the-public show far from his New York stomping ground, in Los
        Angeles’s Chinatown district. The whole event was titled “Fortune City”
        and, as such, leaned into the designer’s Chinese heritage—a theme, it
        should be noted, he had been exploring since before the pandemic and the
        accusations against him. Before Tuesday’s show, he shut down a
        particularly iconic plaza in the neighborhood—neon lights, pagoda-style
        architecture, hanging red lanterns—and guests were invited to peruse the
        local vendors for souvenirs like jade buddhas and beckoning cat
        figurines, along with skewered meats and sweet treats. Proceeds from the
        sales of a limited-edition T-shirt plus an undisclosed amount were
        donated to Chinatown Corporation, an organization dedicated to
        preservation and restoration of the area.For a designer known for his

      <p class="celine">
        Celine was founded in Paris in 1945, when Céline and Richard Vipiana
        opened a custom shoe shop for children, but its modern incarnation dates
        to the 1960s, when the Vipianas began selling ready-to-wear. Luxe
        sportswear with couturelike finishing was, and is, Céline’s raison
        d’être. Michael Kors was brought in to revive the label in the late
        ’90s, but it was Phoebe Philo who made Celine one of the most important
        brands in luxury fashion after she joined in 2007. Critics credited her
        with pushing fashion in a new direction, toward a more spare,
        stripped-down kind of sophistication. What Philo’s Celine offered women
        was, as Vogue put it, “a grown-up and hip way to put themselves
        together.” While Philo’s minimalism may have been interpreted as an
        attempt to realign the prevailing values of the industry, she was, in
        fact, putting the emphasis back on the core fundamentals of Celine. “I
        just thought I’d clean it up,” she said in an interview during those
        early days. “Make it strong and powerful—a kind of contemporary
        minimalism.” Through the 2010s, that minimalism took on an artsier tone
        and influenced an entire generation of young designers (and more than a
        few copycats). Perhaps the only name as influential as Philo’s at that
        time was Hedi Slimane, who shocked the industry by ushering in a
        vintage-y, grungy California vibe at Saint Laurent. When Philo departed
        Celine in late 2017 Slimane was promptly named her successor. Before
        he’d even designed a garment, it was clear his “new Celine” from the
        old. Slimane’s first order of business was to drop the accent over the e
        in Céline Vipiana’s name, just as he’d cut “Yves” from Yves Saint
        Laurent.just as he’d cut “Yves” from Yves Saint Laurent. Who is a

            The Fall season is quickly approaching, which means it’s time to
            store your slides and cute summer sandals, and get ready to invest
            in fall shoes and stylish boots. Sure, your go-to men’s and women’s
            white sneakers will transition nicely for sweater weather, but
            nothing adds an edge to your fall duds quite like Dr. Martens’ most
            iconic styles. For over six decades, Dr. Martens shoes have been a
            symbol of rebellious self-expression. In recent years, the demand
            for Dr. Martens has only increased with the brand’s growing
            cult-like following, which includes celebrity fans like Dua Lipa and
            Olivia Rodrigo. No matter where you look, that Dr. Martens yellow
            welt stitch and signature lug sole is everywhere, especially with
            the combat boots trend on the rise. Best of all, Dr. Martens shoes
            are built to protect your feet from harsh weather and notably stand
            up to snow or rainy conditions with the tough, high-quality
            materials and meticulous construction. The beauty of these iconic
            shoe styles is their versatility, so any outfit can be a Dr. Martens
            outfit. The unisex shoes are built to go with just about anything,
            from office dresses and suits to wide-leg trousers to all your
            favorite jeans. Plus, they’ll outlast every other pair of shoes in
            your closet. To get into the fall spirit, kick off your shoe
            shopping extravaganza with Dr. Martens icons, including the first
            and second shoes the brand ever launched back in the ’60s — the 1460
            boot and the 1461 oxford — as well as the 2976 Chelsea and the Jadon
            platform. The stand-out styles are tough, cool and timeless, making
            them the ideal footwear for this fall and years to come. The Fall
            season is quickly approaching, which means it’s time to store your
            slides and cute summer sandals, and get ready.

            Known for their affordable and accessible interpretations of trends,
            Steve Madden has remained a go-to for customers interested in
            experimenting. Made in vegan leather, these combat boots are cut in
            a classic silhouette, with a slightly elevated platform, making them
            ideal for festival goers. A side zipper allows for ease while
            pulling on, and ties allow for further adjustment ability,
            especially ideal for those who have smaller or weaker ankles. These
            are a perfect pair for those who want the look, and won’t have to
            struggle with breaking in new boots. What Reviewers Say: “These
            boots are everything I dreamed of! They’re exactly as pictured, true
            to size. They’re comfy and ready to wear, no breaking-in necessary.
            It’s also a huge plus that even when I’ve gotten a scuff on them it
            rubs right off!” Dream Pairs offers an affordable, classic combat
            boot, which is ideal for anyone hesitant to overspend. A standout
            feature of the Dream Pairs includes a velvet interior lining from
            the mid-calf through the toe, which will offer added warmth on
            cooler days. With a lug outsole intended to absorb shock and support
            you with each step, you can purchase these with confidence that you
            won’t end up with sore feet at the end of the day. Another feature
            we love is that they’re water-resistance, perfect for a more stylish
            alternative to clunky cold-weather boots. What Reviewers Say: “I’ve
            been a barista for a year now and I got these boots near the
            beginning of starting my job. I LOVE how sturdy these boots have
            been. They’re water resistant and the soles show very little wear
            even though they’ve been my only work shoes for the past year. I am
            shocked at how they still feel and look new even though they’ve been
            in daily use.

            This year, vintage fashion took center stage on the red carpets and
            in paparazzi shots of celebrities. Whether they were attending a
            major event or not, Hollywood A-listers made archival fashion feel
            entirely modern, proving that a well-cut design can stand the test
            of time. There were a few stars who made vintage designs their 2022
            signature. Two standouts from Zendaya were the black Valentino
            strapless gown she wore to the Emmys, and the sculptural, strapless
            Bob Mackie gown in black and teak (from fall 1998) that she wore to
            a Time 100 Gala. Model Bella Hadid is also a noted fan of pre-loved
            fashion (shes known to after all). At the Cannes Film Festival, she
            wore a white Tom Ford-era Gucci column gown with a hip cutout, and a
            frothy fall 1986 Chanel gown. The thing that Zendaya and Hadid have
            in common? They were both styled by Law Roach, who has an eye for
            throwback finds. “No matter if it was made in 1920 or 2020, a great
