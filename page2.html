        <h2 class="guccititle">Gucci's Takeover</h2>
        <p class="guccitext">
          Gucci’s new creative director is Sabato De Sarno. When his appointment
          was announced last month, the brand said his first collection would be
          spring 2024. That gave the Gucci studio the job of designing this
          in-between season, sandwiched in the middle of Alessandro Michele’s
          Twinsburg sign-off and De Sarno’s opening salvo. The Gucci hub had
          been stripped down to puce green carpeting and burgundy banquettes for
          the occasion. In the middle were two sunken circles—the show notes
          said they “represented the collaborative circularity at the heart of
          Gucci’s creative community”; my seatmate called them influencer pits
          because they were filled with social media machers. The outer ring is
          where the celebrities sat: Dakota Johnson, A$AP Rocky, the Maneskin
          foursome, Florence Welch, and Julia Garner among them. Outside on the
          Via Mecenate, the crowd whooped for Chinese singer and actor Xiao
          Zhan; he was perched next to Gucci CEO Marco Bizzarri. Like the men’s
          show that preceded it in January, the collection jumped this way and
          that, from the ’90s slimline tailoring of Tom Ford’s Gucci era to more
          eccentric stylings in the spirit of Michele. Both designers are part
          of the house’s heritage now, but Ford and Michele became famous by
          never doing anything halfway. Parenthetical collections like this one
          tend to be more noncommittal.

          Last Thursday, Miuccia Prada closed day two of Milan Fashion Week with
          a show held in a new building on the outskirts of the city. Featuring
          neon-bright nylon, archival motifs and more than a few pairs of the
          tiny sunglasses we’ve seen over the course of the last few seasons,
          the presentation was also attended by a computer-generated influencer,
          @lilmiquela. Miquela wasn’t the only one present who caused
          conversation, though. The first model to hit the runway was
          relative-unknown Anok Yai – making her the first black woman to open
          at Prada since Naomi Campbell, way back in 1997. Student Yai was
          signed to Next Management last year, after photographer Steve Hall
          posted an image of her at Howard University’s homecoming festival
          ‘Yardfest’ to his IG account. It quickly went viral on both Instagram
          and Twitter, with the agency contacting Yai soon after. “When I
          spotted Anok, I was enamoured,” said the photographer. “There was
          something simple but piercing about her look.”

          Prada is a luxury fashion brand known for its minimalist yet
          innovative designs. It offers a wide range of products including
          clothing, accessories, and fragrances that exude sophistication and
          elegance.

          Prada is undoubtedly progressive in many ways – this season’s
          collection was designed with a ‘female utopia’ in mind, in which women
          could walk the streets at night without fear, and Miuccia has long
          been a staunch advocate of feminism and women’s rights. However, after
          Naomi Campbell’s appearance on the runway in 1997, it wasn’t until
          2008 that another black model, Jourdan Dunn, walked for Miuccia. In
          2013, Malaika Firth was the first black model booked to star in a
          Prada campaign since 1994.The AW18 show marks Yai’s second appearance
          as part of a Prada show, after her debut at the menswear show of the
          same season in January. The model also stars in the Italian label’s
          SS18 ad campaign. Speaking to British Vogue after Thursday’s
          presentation, Yai described opening for Prada as “an honour,” before
          going on to say that the decision was bigger than her. “Me opening for
          one of the top fashion houses is a statement to the world – especially
          for black women – that their beauty is something that deserves to be
          celebrated,” she explained. With two Prada shows now under her belt,
          we think it’s safe to say that Yai’s phone will be ringing off the
          hook when it comes to bookings from now on. But we also hope that the
          excitement with which this moment has been met means that we’ll be
          seeing a lot more diversity on her catwalk in future seasons. Never
          mind Miquela and her computer-generated counterparts. Let’s celebrate
          IRL girls of all races and ethnicities too.
